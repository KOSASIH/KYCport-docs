Creating a dynamic risk scoring system involves a number of steps, including:

Identify relevant risk factors: Start by identifying the risk factors that are relevant for your business or industry. This may include factors such as location, transaction history, user behavior, and more.

Assign weights to each factor: Once you have identified the relevant risk factors, you need to assign weights to each one based on their relative importance. For example, you may decide that location is a more important factor than transaction history, and assign it a higher weight.

Establish thresholds: Next, you need to establish thresholds for each risk factor. For example, you may decide that any transaction over a certain amount is automatically flagged as high-risk, or that any user who has attempted to log in from a certain country is automatically flagged for review.

Calculate risk scores: Using the weights and thresholds you have established, you can then calculate a risk score for each user or transaction. This score can be used to determine the appropriate level of review or intervention needed.

Continuously monitor and adjust: Finally, it is important to continuously monitor and adjust your risk scoring system based on new data and trends. This may involve revisiting your risk factors, adjusting weights and thresholds, or incorporating new data sources.

Overall, creating a dynamic risk scoring system requires careful consideration of the relevant risk factors, thoughtful weighting and threshold setting, and ongoing monitoring and adjustment. With the right approach, however, such a system can help businesses identify and prevent potential fraud and other risks.


here's an example table for a dynamic risk scoring system:

Factor					Weight	Score
Source of funds				0.2	0-5
Country of origin			0.2	0-5
Type of business			0.1	0-3
Nature of transaction			0.1	0-3
Customer due diligence			0.1	0-3
Sanctions list matches			0.1	0-3
Politically exposed person (PEP) status	0.1	0-2
Adverse media				0.1	0-2
Total Score				1	0-24

This table includes various factors that can affect the risk score of a user or transaction, such as the source of funds, country of origin, type of business, nature of the transaction, and more. Each factor is given a weight that reflects its importance in determining the overall risk score, and a score is assigned based on the level of risk associated with that factor (for example, a high-risk country of origin may receive a score of 4 or 5, while a low-risk country may receive a score of 1 or 2).

The total score is calculated by summing the weighted scores for each factor. Based on the total score, the user or transaction can be categorized into different risk levels (for example, a score of 0-5 may be considered low risk, while a score of 18-24 may be considered high risk). This dynamic risk scoring system can help KYCport.com clients quickly assess the risk associated with each user or transaction and take appropriate action to mitigate that risk.
